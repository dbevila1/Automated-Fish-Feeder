# Automated-Fish-Feeder
A system that feeds a fish once a day and reminds you to change the water once a week. This runs on a TI MSP430, some other hardware used include, bread board, micro servo, LED, switch, and speaker.
This was a project I completed in association with Michael Garlak, John Yuhe Luan, and Kaushik Anantha at the November 2016 Ohio State University (OHI/O) Hackathon.
